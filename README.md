# Machine Learning & Data Science Exploration

Welcome to my journey of mastering **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Data Science (DS)** through hands-on projects. This repo documents my learning path, experiments, and progress as I work on real-world applications, from **supervised learning models** to **ML pipelines** and **computer vision**.

### Target Areas:

1. **Supervised Learning on Structured Data** (e.g., Regression, Classification)
   - **Why**: With solid experience in cleaning and processing data (via Pandas, SQL), Iâ€™m focusing on developing models like **logistic regression, decision trees, random forests**, and **XGBoost**. These skills are central to most data science work and will enhance my ability to predict outcomes, from campaign success to churn and election turnout predictions.
   - **Next Steps**: Experimenting with regression and classification models using **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost** on existing datasets.

2. **Data Engineering for ML Pipelines**
   - **Why**: Leveraging my experience with ETL pipelines and cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure), Iâ€™m strengthening my ability to build automated ML pipelines that integrate data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation â€” a crucial skill for moving models into production.
   - **Next Steps**: Exploring tools like **Airflow**, **Kubeflow**, and **MLflow** for orchestrating scalable ML pipelines. Iâ€™ll also dive into model deployment on **AWS SageMaker** and **Google AI Platform**.

3. **Applied Computer Vision (Basic Level)**
   - **Why**: Starting with basic image classification and object detection can set me apart in industries like healthcare and civic tech, where image analysis plays a key role.
   - **Next Steps**: Working with **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, or **PyTorch** to build basic image classification or object detection models.

4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - **Why**: NLP is critical for extracting insights from text data in fields like civic tech, public health, and campaign work. Tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition will complement my work in data science and offer solutions for analyzing social media, healthcare documents, and voter sentiment.
  - **Next Steps**: Exploring NLTK, SpaCy, and Hugging Face Transformers to perform text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition using publicly available datasets.

### Key Tools & Libraries:
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating models.
- **XGBoost / LightGBM**: For advanced tree-based models.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**: For deep learning, especially in computer vision and NLP.
- **SQL / Pandas / NumPy**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and scaling.
- **MLflow / Kubeflow**: For managing and orchestrating ML pipelines.
- **AWS / GCP / Azure**: For cloud-based data engineering and model deployment.
- **NLTK / SpaCy / Hugging Face Transformers**: For NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.

### Next Steps:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Dive deeper into regression and classification models using scikit-learn, applying them to current datasets like **campaign data** and **voter turnout predictions**.
2. **ML Pipelines**: Implement automated pipelines, applying **ETL** and **model deployment** techniques.
3. **Computer Vision**: Explore basic image processing and classification tasks, such as detecting trends in **voter behavior** or **campaign materials**.
4. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Experiment with text classification and sentiment analysis using **NLTK**, **SpaCy**, or **Hugging Face Transformers**, applying these techniques to social media data or campaign outreach.

### Sharpening My Competitive Edge:
- **Portfolio Projects**: This repo will document all my work, including **predictive modeling**, **ML pipelines**, and **computer vision projects**. Real-world projects like **predicting election turnout** or **campaign optimization** will be great additions to my portfolio.
- **Networking**: Iâ€™ll engage with organizations that focus on **data science for social good** and **civic tech** to leverage my skills in areas like health, public policy, and social impact.
- **Internships/Contract Work**: Short-term roles will help accelerate my transition into **data science** and **machine learning** while solidifying my skills and expanding my portfolio.
