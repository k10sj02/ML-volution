Machine Learning & Data Science Exploration

Welcome to my journey of mastering Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) through hands-on projects. This repo documents my learning path, experiments, and progress as I work on real-world applications, from supervised learning models to ML pipelines and computer vision.

Target Areas of Focus:
	1.	Supervised Learning on Structured Data (e.g., Regression, Classification)
	•	Why: With solid experience in cleaning and processing data (via Pandas, SQL), I’m focusing on developing models like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and XGBoost. These skills are central to most data science work and will enhance my ability to predict outcomes, from campaign success to churn and election turnout predictions.
	•	Next Steps: Experimenting with regression and classification models using scikit-learn and XGBoost on existing datasets.
	2.	Data Engineering for ML Pipelines
	•	Why: Leveraging my experience with ETL pipelines and cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, Azure), I’m strengthening my ability to build automated ML pipelines that integrate data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation — a crucial skill for moving models into production.
	•	Next Steps: Exploring tools like Airflow, Kubeflow, and MLflow for orchestrating scalable ML pipelines. I’ll also dive into model deployment on AWS SageMaker and Google AI Platform.
	3.	Applied Computer Vision (Basic Level)
	•	Why: As my mentor specializes in computer vision, this is a great opportunity to expand my skill set into this domain. Starting with basic image classification and object detection can set me apart in industries like healthcare and civic tech, where image analysis plays a key role.
	•	Next Steps: Working with OpenCV, TensorFlow, or PyTorch to build basic image classification or object detection models, collaborating with my mentor to refine these skills.

Key Tools & Libraries:
	•	Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating models.
	•	XGBoost / LightGBM: For advanced tree-based models.
	•	TensorFlow / PyTorch: For deep learning, especially in computer vision and NLP.
	•	SQL / Pandas / NumPy: For data cleaning, manipulation, and scaling.
	•	MLflow / Kubeflow: For managing and orchestrating ML pipelines.
	•	AWS / GCP / Azure: For cloud-based data engineering and model deployment.

Next Steps:
	1.	Supervised Learning: Dive deeper into regression and classification models using scikit-learn, applying them to current datasets like campaign data and voter turnout predictions.
	2.	ML Pipelines: Implement automated pipelines in my current role at Shape Up the Vote or UNICEF, applying ETL and model deployment techniques.
	3.	Computer Vision: Collaborate with my mentor to explore basic image processing and classification tasks, such as detecting trends in voter behavior or campaign materials.

Job Market Competitiveness:
	•	Portfolio Projects: This repo will document all my work, including predictive modeling, ML pipelines, and computer vision projects. Real-world projects like predicting election turnout or campaign optimization will be great additions to my portfolio.
	•	Networking: I’ll engage with organizations that focus on data science for social good and civic tech to leverage my skills in areas like health, public policy, and social impact.
	•	Internships/Contract Work: Short-term roles will help accelerate my transition into data science and machine learning while solidifying my skills and expanding my portfolio.
